# Project-1---Udacity-Front-End-Web-Development-Nanodegree

This project required me to build a structure of a website using semantic HTML, and style websites with CSS and responsive layouts. Additionaly I had to develop an understanding of different use cases for CSS Grid and Flexbox, and structure the layout of a web page using grid columns and rows.
