## Project Objectective
This project required me to build a structure of a website using semantic HTML, and style websites with CSS and responsive layouts. Additionaly I had to develop an understanding of different use cases for CSS Grid and Flexbox, and structure the layout of a web page using grid columns and rows.

## Building
- decide on and set the overall structure.
- create some mock pages of the website.
- build out the HTML for the main page.
- build the HTML for the example blog post.
- style pages with CSS
- link pages
- test

## Languages I used: 
1. HTML
2. CSS
