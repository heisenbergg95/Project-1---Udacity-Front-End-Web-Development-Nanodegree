                            Curious and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. 
                            During my studies at Politecnico di Milano (Italy), I began to be fascinated by web programming, 
                            including developing apps and building websites.
                            I also really enjoy outdoor sports, and during my free time you’ll find me looking at the stars!

                <p class="description">S5 0014+81 is not a random sequence of numbers that i dreamt about the other night, but it is one 
                    of the most powerful object in the Universe, as far as we know. Since i was a kid i always have been fascinated by the 
                    concept of black holes, stars, planets and space in general, but this one has a particular relevance. Why ? Well it’s 
                    pretty obvious why, because it could erase humanity from the face of the Earth in the blink of an eye.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Scared ? Well, you should be, and let’s see the reason: let me introduce to you to this huge monster that astrophysicists 
                    like to call S5 0014+81.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Precisely it is a enormous, dense, superbright blazar located extremely far from the Earth, something like 12 bilions of 
                    light-years. If you don’t know exactly what a blazar is, well, in few words, it’s just kind of a giant elliptical galaxy that 
                    hosts a supermassive black hole in the center. Scientists discovered that S5 0014+81 has a mass corrisponding to 40,000,000,000 
                    solar masses and a radius that is 800 times the distance between Earth and the Sun.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So? Just how big it is? Well, it’s kinda impossible to answer that beacause it would be already difficult to imagine how big 
                    the Sun is, and… <span class="text-underlined">this beast is way bigger than the Sun.</span> Unfortunatly this huge blazar is not visible at the naked eye 
                    (actually this is a good thing, otherwise we all would be already dead by now), but who knows if someday far in the future,
                     when humanity will become a III type civilization, if we will be able to capture and use part of the energy of this big boy. 
                     Surely i would like to be alive to see that but unfortunatly i think it will still take some time for humanity to be there.
